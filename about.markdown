# About

I'm Shiva. My goal is to Make Life Predictable. Handle Unpredictability. Time, money, family, friends and other resources are limited and precious. We do not want to waste them on handling preditable events and that when an unpredictable event happens, you are out of them. Having a predictable life can done by making very small changes to our way of living. Through series of blogs, I hope to convince and inspire you to lead a predictable life and enjoy your time and money with family, friends, outdoors, indoors etc. and be prepared for unpredicatable situations.
