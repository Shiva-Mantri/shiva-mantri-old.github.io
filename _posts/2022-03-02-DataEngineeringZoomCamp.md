One of the things that I learned over the last one year is **Have a singular focus**. 
- Focus on task at hand. Do not juggle. 
- Focus and finish it before moving on to next.

Over the last month or so, I started doing [Data Engineer Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp){:target="_blank"}. Amazing camp by [DataTalks Club](https://www.youtube.com/c/DataTalksClub){:target="_blank"}. Thanks to amazing [instructions](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp#instructors){:target="_blank"} for tutorials, quiz and Q&A office hours.

In the coming weeks, I start posting blogs about the course, any tips that I came across and more.
